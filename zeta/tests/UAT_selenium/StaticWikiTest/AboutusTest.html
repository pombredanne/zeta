	<td>=== Why we engineered this tool<br /><br />There are several reasons why we wanted a tool like this. A few of<br />them I will list here,<br /><br />* A generic bug / effort tracking tool that can be tailored to our needs.<br />* We wanted a flexible, version controlled document application,&nbsp;&nbsp;\<br />enabling multiple users to collaborate in writing documents.<br />* Support for multiple projects without complicating user's participation with \<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;projects.<br />* A permission system, that is simple yet flexible.<br />* Full integration with your favorite editors, email server(s) and version \<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;control system.<br />* Data analytics, for projects as well as for your source code.<br /><br />We hope to cover all our needs in near future along with yours. So do send an<br />[[ mailto:support@discoverzeta.com | email ]] letting us know what you want.<br />And yes, we know that there are several similar tools out there in the market. For us,<br />there were reasons for not picking one of them, but for you, we hope there<br />will be a reason to pick ours for yourself.<br /><br />=== People<br /><br />: Pratap :: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal developer, started this activity and running this for <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ YearsBefore('past %s', '2008') }}.<br /><br />=== Test Header<br />Line added for testing<br /><br />/* vim: set filetype=zwiki : */</td>
