Mozilla Firefox is a free and open source web browser descended from the
Mozilla Application Suite, managed by the
[[ www.mozilla.com | Mozilla Corporation]]. Firefox had
20.78% of the recorded usage share of web browsers as of November 2008, making
it the second-most popular browser in current use worldwide, after Internet
Explorer.

To display web pages, Firefox uses the //Gecko// layout engine, which implements
some current web standards plus a few features which are intended to
anticipate likely additions to the standards.

Firefox includes,
* tabbed browsing,
* a spell checker,
* incremental find,
* live bookmarking,
* a download manager,
* an integrated search system that uses the user's desired search engine.

Functions can be added through add-ons created by third-party developers,
the most popular of which include the //NoScript// JavaScript disabling utility,
//Tab Mix//, //Plus customizer//, //FoxyTunes// media player control toolbar,
//Adblock Plus// ad blocking utility, //StumbleUpon// (website
discovery), //Foxmarks// Bookmark Synchronizer (bookmark synchronizer),
//DownThemAll!// download enhancer, and Web Developer toolbar.

Firefox runs on various versions of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and
many other Unix-like operating systems. Its current stable release is version
3.0.5, released on December 16, 2008.[7] Firefox's source code is free
software, released under a tri-license GPL/LGPL/MPL.[8]

Mozilla supports tabbed browsing, which allows users to open multiple web
pages in the same browser window. This feature was written with the popular
MultiZilla extension for Mozilla as a base. Mozilla also belongs in the group
of browsers who early on adopted customizable pop-up blocking.

The browser has a number of features which help users find information. First,
Mozilla has an incremental find feature known as "find as you type". With this
feature enabled, a user can simply begin typing a word while viewing a web
page, and the browser automatically searches for it and highlights the first
instance found. As the user types more of the word, the browser refines its
search.

Additionally, Mozilla supports the "custom keyword" feature. This feature
allows users to access their bookmarks from the location bar using keywords
(and an optional query parameter). For example, using a custom keyword, a user
can type "google apple" into the address bar and be redirected to the results
of a Google search for "apple".

For the mail and newsgroup component, the built-in Bayesian e-mail spam filter
can effectively filter out unwanted e-mail spam after a period of training.
""",
u"""
Mozilla introduced the extension model, which was expanded and improved by
Firefox and Thunderbird. Through extensions (installed via XPInstall modules),
users may activate new features, such as mouse gestures, advertisement
blocking, proxy server switching, and debugging tools.

One can view the extension system as a ground for experimentation, where one
can test new functionalities. Occasionally, an extension, or a part of it,
becomes part of the official product (for example MultiZilla's tabbed browsing
feature eventually became part of the standard Mozilla).

Mozilla also supports a variety of themes/skins, which change its appearance.
Themes consist of packages of CSS and image files. The Mozilla Add-ons website
offers many themes. Beyond adding a new theme, users can customize its
interface by adding and removing some of its buttons and toolbars.

Additionally, Mozilla stores most of its preferences in a list that users can
access by typing about:config in the address bar. Some preferences are only
available through it, like turning on bookmark icons
""",
u"""
The Mozilla Foundation takes pride in Mozilla's compliance with existing
standards, especially W3C web standards. Mozilla has extensive support for
most basic standards including HTML, XML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, MathML,
DTD, XSLT and XPath.

Mozilla also supports PNG images and variable transparency, (which Internet
Explorer only supports fully in version 7). Indeed, Internet Explorer's lack
of support for PNG images has occasioned much debate, as many web developers
want to move away from the old GIF format, which does not have the same
capabilities and image quality as PNG.

Mozilla has implemented most of CSS Level 2 and some of the not-yet-completed
CSS Level 3 standard. It was among the first browsers to pass the original Box
Acid Test, although it doesn't fully pass the more rigorous Acid2 test for
HTML, CSS, and PNG standards support. Other browsers based on newer versions
of Mozilla's core technology, however, pass the Acid2 test.

The mail and newsgroup supports POP and IMAP. It also support LDAP address
completion. Both reading and writing of HTML e-mails are supported.

The first version of the suite (i.e., the one that formed the basis of
Netscape 6) did not support the blink element, thus making it the only
Netscape/Mozilla browser that has not supported the notorious tag that
Netscape itself created. Later versions of the suite support the element as
well as the marquee tag, originally created by rival Internet Explorer.
""",
u"""
Mozilla runs on a wide variety of platforms. Releases available on the
primary distribution site support the following operating systems:

* Various versions of Microsoft Windows, including 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0,
  2000, XP, Server 2003, and Vista.
* Mac OS X
* Mac OS 9 (discontinued after Mozilla 1.2.1, but an unofficial Mozilla 1.3.1
  is available here.)
* Linux-based operating systems using X.Org Server or
* XFree86

Mozilla uses the same format to store users' profiles (which contain their
personal browser settings) even on different operating systems, so a profile may
be used on multiple platforms, so long as all of the platforms can
access the profile (e.g., the profile is stored on a FAT32 partition accessible
from both Windows and Linux). This functionality is useful for users who
dual-boot their machines. However, it may occasionally cause problems,
especially with extensions.
""",
u"""
Mozilla comes with 3 web development tools: a DOM Inspector, Venkman and
JavaScript Console. The DOM Inspector is not available in non-Mozilla
browsers, and the JavaScript Console is more advanced than the consoles
available in non-Mozilla browsers. Venkman is a difficult to use but decent
JavaScript debugger. These are installed by default, though you can opt them
out (except for the JavaScript Console) with the other install options.

Mozilla Firefox 3 was released on June 17, 2008[22] by the Mozilla

redesigned download manager, a new "Places" system for storing bookmarks and
history, and separate themes for different operating systems. The current
version is Firefox 3.0.10. Development stretches back to the first Firefox 3
beta (under the codename 'Gran Paradiso'[24]) which had been released several
months earlier on 19 November 2007,[25] and was followed by several more beta

improving and removing XPCOM APIs, switching to standard C++ features,
just-in-time compilation with JavaScript 2 (known as the Tamarin project), and
tool-time and runtime security checks.[45][46] It has also been announced that
support for the Gopher protocol will be removed by default to lessen attack
