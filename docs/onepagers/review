Since, we focus our effort to support projects that involves digitized
content, we have to address the second most important process (the first
being Version Control ) that a project ought to follow. That is "review",
called with various names as "peer review", "source inspections" and many more ...

Be it water-fall model, or spiral model, structured programming or extreme
programming, review process have always found a place in all of them. We
facilitate users to review source files in repository or wiki documents at
their place at their time. All that matters are their comments.

Create a review with author, moderator and participants, where each of them
will have respective permissions to update review attributes, while all of
them will have permissions to comment on the review resource or reply to
other's comments. More than that, review source files as you view / navigate
and edit them with your editor or IDE, and don't bother to open your bowser to
add your comments.
