Everyone who have worked in a project or a program would have heard about
milestones. Its quite often used, but never been so far called as an over-used
term, as its importance is unlikely to diminish.

Milestone is a point where hypothesis are expected to become facts, investments
show results, ideas become reality. It is the fulcrum where a team of people
lift themselves from one plane to a higher plane. 

Our collaboration tools support milestone, but we kept it simple and leave the
policies to the team. Though, we encourage others to use what we call as 
the "window of trinity" in defining and managing milestones.
They are appropriate called as "current", "next" and "future".

"future" milestone is like a parking lot, where all initial ideas, objectives and
activities are grouped. And as we execute the project wanting more functions
to be completed, we park them under "future" milestone. Once we understand
project's current scope, and demands it needs to meet, cherry-pick the functions
out of "future" and move them to "current". When executing the project, functions
that do not have enough clarity or functions that are important but not urget
can be moved to "next" milestone.

Overall, this method, gives a roadmap of what your team is doing today, what
it is planning to do in near future and the scope of its entire work.
