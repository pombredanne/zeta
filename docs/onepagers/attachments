Attachments became popular along with E-mail. Nowadays, attachment seem to
accompany everything that is sent across the wire. Zeta is not an
exception, which allows user to attach files to anything, be it a wiki page,
ticket or even a license page. Afterall, having integrated zeta with e-mail
applications, it only becomes natural to support attachments.

And we dont stop just at this, we combine attachments with tags, allowing
users to classify and manage attachments in interesting ways. For instance, by
tagging an attachment as `download` it automatically gets highlighted where
ever downloadable files are expected.
