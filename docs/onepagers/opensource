We think open-source in beyond any economic reasoning, so we don't want
to define it or reason with it. We have simply embraced it, and we breath with
it. But we don't accept or follow the dogmas that many would want to
preach. Some even go to the extent of converting open source into something
that they can understand and eventually control.

We have almost entirely built our applications using open source software.

When there is freedom to consume others work, there should also be freedom to
demand something in return. For us, this must be sufficient enough to get
along with our application, its dependancies and its business. While we have
not open sourced our work, we would gladly to it when time permits. In
between now and then, we will open source as mush work as possible for "free"
for common benefit, like how we have benefited so far.
