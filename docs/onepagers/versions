While milestones are about future, versions leave a track record of past.
Time to time, a team shall log their activities and tag them when they reach a
logical point, they can be called as versions. Having a formal procedure to
do so will help in releasing your work to outside world, either to get initial
feedback, or may be for real world applications.

After a point, especially when more people are involved in a common goal, it
is hard to say when the goal is met, or when the work is ready for real
world application. Hence all the jargons like `pre-alpha`, `alpha`, `beta`,
`release candidates` have cropped up. Your team can pick up an appropriate
process to suite their style. But it is always the consumers who say whether
your work is production ready.

As usual our tool gives provision for managing your versions, while we leave
the policies to your team. We strive to make the tool suite your process, not
the vice versa.
