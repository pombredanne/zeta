Project, is our term for a collaboration instance, under which members can
come together as a team to build / maintain or manage their activities.

    '' My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept
       each other's negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other.
       And the total was greater than the sum of the parts. Great things in
       business are not done by one person, they are done by a team of
       people ''
                    - Steve jobs                

If you think you can connect with this statement, probably you will be
able to appreciate the need and importance of project collaboration, which is
what Zeta is all about. We strive to keep it un-cluttered, intuitive and
seemlessly integrate with your day today activities. Believe it or not, it is
quite difficult to meet this challenge. 

But a word of caution is to be presented here, no matter how powerfull
technology can become, a tool is just a tool, more than the tool it is
people and their technique that defines quality and productivity. We work
hard to the help the tool suite those people, not the other way around.
