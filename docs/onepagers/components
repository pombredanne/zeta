    Managing many is the same as managing few,
        It is a question of division.
                                - Sun Tzu, Chapter 5.

Organization and management has come a long way from its simple beginnings. We
manage in a heirarchy style or matrix style or more recently, flat style ..
No matter what style and method one follows, one cannot get away with the "art of
division". 

To execute projects, considering Frederick Brooks' diagram on "Evolution of a

    * understanding the specifics
    * abstracting and generalizing the specifics
    * interfacing them
    * documentating and testing
    * and, the question of maintanence

In our tool, we provide two ways to correlate with your project's
organisation. One, by creating multiple collaboration instance and
two, by creating components within a single collaboration instance. In both
ways, find suitable people to be your project-administrators and
component-owners, who could share the same will.
