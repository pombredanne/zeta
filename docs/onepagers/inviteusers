There is a traditional method of user-registration available for users who
wants to join your site or who should be joining your site. The registration
process is simple, requiring a unique `username`, `emailid`, and user-timezone.
Since our registration and authentication process is quite modular, we can
entirely avoid user registration via web, and happily integrate user
authentication with other applications like LDAP, OpenID etc ...

Alternately, there is provision for user registration by invitation. Site
administrator or any registered user (based on configuration) can invite users
to register with their site. An email will be sent to the invited user, who
can use the inivitation link to register.
