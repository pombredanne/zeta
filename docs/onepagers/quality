    " Quality is the continuing stimulus which our environment puts
      upon us to create the world in which we live. All of it. Every
      last bit of it.

      Now, to take that which has caused us to create the world, and
      include it within the world we have created, is clearly
      impossible. That is why Quality cannot be defined. If we do
      define it we are defining something less than Quality itself."

But that is philosophy isn't it. In terms of nuts and bolts, we have
implemented three levels of quality control. Like,

    * Unit test case for every component and its functions, which randomized
      and regressable as much as possible.
    * User Acceptance testing, emulating a user accessing the site via web.
    * Release-upgrade-Regression, where every new release used as upgrade for
      all the previous releases and regressed.

Out metrics says that, we have written about a line of test code for evey line
of development code.

We also have beta deployments which act as a test bed to take a stable release
into public release.
