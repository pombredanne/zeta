Our objective is to make the tool suitable for projects and teams not the
other way around. To fullfill that objective we have integrated Zeta with other
applications like editors, IDEs, E-mail, version control system etc ... Once
setup, there are so many ways to interact with the Zeta server, apart from
browser. 

Any application client can push or pull data from server using XMLRPC apis
defined and exposed Zeta. Ofcourse, the client can do so, only after it is
authenticated and authorized.

Some the applications that already have a Zeta client,
     * Vim
