== ZWiki Extensions

ZWiki Extension is a plugin like framework to extend wiki engine itself. One
can define new markups, text formats etc ... and integrate it with ZWiki as an
extension.

=== Extension Framework

Extented wiki text can be added into the main document by enclosing them within
triple curly braces '' }} ''. Everything between the curly braces
are passed directly to the extension module, which, in most of the cases will
return a translated HTML text. The general format while using a wiki extension
is,

> Ё屮翦铙轱瞽钺礤Ё箴徙箦疱蜥翦疳蜥礤翦颦篝蜷铉蟑Ё痱镳弪豉钺礤Ё鲠祯瀵Ё痱镳弪豉钺礤Ё鲠祯瀵Ё鏖腴翦Ё}}

* ''extension-name'', should be one of the valid extensions.
* ''parameter-strings'', string values that will be passed as parameters.
* ''property-name'', property name can be a property accepted by the extension
  module or can be CSS property. Note that, the entire property block should
  be marked by a beginning ''hash (#)''

=== Box

: Description ::
    Generate a box with title and content. Text within the curly braces will be
    interpreted as the content and can contain ZWiki text as well. If title
    text is provided, then the extension can take parameter ''hide'' which
    can be used to shrink/expand box content.

:Example ::

> [<PRE
{{{ Box hide
#{
# 'title' : 'Building A Mnesia Database',
# 'style' : { 'margin-left' : '5%', 'margin-right' : '5%' },
# 'titlestyle' : 'color: brown;',
# 'contentstyle' : 'color: gray;',
#}

This chapter details the basic steps involved when designing a Mnesia database
and the programming constructs which make different solutions available to the
programmer. The chapter includes the following sections,

* defining a schema
* the datamodel
* starting Mnesia
* creating new tables.

special property key-value pairs,

|= title        | optional, title string
|= titlestyle   | optional, title style string in CSS style format
|= contentstyle | optional, content style string in CSS style format

Default CSS styling for title,
> [<PRE {'color': 'black', 'padding-right': '3px', 'background': '#EEEEEE', 'padding-bottom': '3px', 'padding-top': '3px', 'font-weight': 'bold', 'padding-left': '3px'} >]

Default CSS styling for content,
> [<PRE {'padding-top': '3px', 'padding-right': '3px', 'padding-left': '3px', 'padding-bottom': '3px'} >]

Default CSS styling for the entire extension,
> [<PRE {'color': 'gray', 'border-left': 'thin solid gray', 'border-top': 'thin solid gray', 'border-bottom': 'thin solid gray', 'border-right': 'thin solid gray'} >]


=== Code

: Description ::
    Syntax highlighting for code-snippet. Highlighting is available for
    [[ /help/pygments | several-dozen formats ]], refer to the //Alias// field
    to invoke the correct highligher.

'' Example ''

> [<PRE  {{{ Code C
    struct process {
      struct process *next;
      const char *name;
      PT_THREAD((* thread)(struct pt *, process_event_t, process_data_t));
      struct pt pt;
      unsigned char state;
    };
  }}} >]

{{{ Code C
struct process {
  struct process *next;
  const char *name;
  PT_THREAD((* thread)(struct pt *, process_event_t, process_data_t));
  struct pt pt;
  unsigned char state;
};
}}}

To highlight a different syntax, supply the syntax name as a parameter like,
> [<PRE {{{ Code <syntax-name> >]

To disable line numbers while highlighting add parameter 'noln'. The default
is to list the line numbers.
> [<PRE {{{ Code <syntax-name> nonl >]



=== Footnote
:Description::
    Generate footnotes that can be referenced. Note that each foot note block
    should be aligned at the left side after the foot-note anchor name,
    even if it is a multiline foot-note. And the foot-note anchor name should
    be aligned with the begining of the line.

:Example ::

foot-note content can be specified like,
> [<PRE
{{{ Footnote footnote-title
1 German-born Swiss-American theoretical physicist, philosopher and
  author who is widely regarded as one of the most influential and best
  known scientists and intellectuals of all time. He is often regarded as
  the father of modern physics.

2 American physicist known for his work in the path integral
  formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics.
}}} >]

Note that inside the ''Footnote'' extension block, each footnote should be
seperated by an empty line and each footnote's first word will be interpreted
as its anchor name, which can be referenced else where like,

> ... mentioned by Richard Feynman [<FN 1 >], initially proposed by Albert Einstein  [<FN 2 >]

... mentioned by Richard Feynman [<FN 1 >], initially proposed by
  Albert Einstein  [<FN 2 >]
...
