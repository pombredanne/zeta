h3. Upgrades to existing Deployments

Upgrades where started sometime during 0.43dev release, and some form of
upgrades have started for database from version 0.8

Also refer to
[[ http://dev.discoverzeta.com/help/upgradeInstallation | uprade guide ]]
that accompanies every zeta deployment.

h4. Upgrading Zeta and Zwiki via egg

Obtain latest zeta and zwiki egg-packages. First install Zwiki and then
install Zeta. Installation should take care of the dependant packages as
well.

h4. Upgrading Database

When ever database related files, (which are under ''zeta/model/*'') are changed
make sure to add an entry in this file and corresponding ''upgrade_*'' function
under ''zeta/model/upgrade.py''. Also change the dbversion in 
''zeta/config/environment.py'' to the next version.

:  Schema changes ::
    If the table schema has changed. Or new tables added, existing tables
    deleted etc ...

:  Transformed data ::
    If data is transformed before being stored into the database, or if the
    transformation algorithm has changed, then its effect should be replicated on
    older versions of database as well.

Always push the latest standard file under staticfiles into the `staticwiki`
table

h4. Upgrading environment directory

Should be handled by the application automatically, when the latest
version of application is restarted. Otherwise, make sure to add an entry in
this file, and corresponding ''upgrade_*'' function under

''zeta/lib/upgradeenv.py''

Changes to standard files in enviroment directory,
    * Standard files under the environement directory is changed.
    * Clean the <env-path>/data/* directories and when doing so, dont forget to
      re-index the database for searching, build analytics for charting and
      reports.

Changes to configuration files,
    * Changes to configuration files need to be updated manually.

Always copy the latest standard file under staticfiles into deployment's
environment directory
